**About Dataset:**

Heart disease is broad term used for diseases and conditions affecting the heart and circulatory system. They are also referred as cardiovascular diseases. It is a major cause of disability all around the world. Since heart is amongst the most vital organs of the body, its diseases affect other organs and part of the body as well. There are several different types and forms of heart diseases. The most common ones cause narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, malfunctioning in the valves of the heart, enlargement in the size of heart and several others leading to heart failure and heart attack.

Its the heart disease dataset from this dataset we can derive various insights that help us know the weightage of each feature and how they are interrelated to each other but this time our sole aim is to detect the probability of person that will be affected by a savior heart problem or not.
